  				This is regular text. It is a descriptive paragraph that tells you all about the items in this section. The description is good. And long enough to show you the boxes. It must be longer. But it is not Latin. The spacing was more frustrating than it should have been. Why can I not automatically clear the amount of space used, like in relative, but not have it the entire width? There must be something I'm missing here.
